            In this project, we learned how to render realistic lighting via the concept of ray tracing and various illumination techniques including direct and global illumination as well as adaptive sampling that reduces noise. This project resonated with our prior knowledge and experience with graphics as ray tracing is an idea that has commonly popped up in the graphics, VFX, and gaming worlds that made hyper-realistic renders a reality, and it was very interesting to learn how ray tracing worked and the computations necessary to make ray-traced illumination function correctly and realistically.

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Intersection</h2>
        
        <p>
            In order to generate a ray, we first changed the hFov and vFov into radians. Then we calculated the max y and y’s by basically taking the tan of half the hFov and vFov. 
            Then, we offset the image by 0.5 x and y. We also then scaled it by dividing the max x and y by 0.5. Then we took those scaled values and multiplied them by the offsets. 
            We used these values to create the final ray. After that we set final ray’s min and max t values to nClip and fClip. Then we return final ray.

            We used the Moller Trumbore Algorithm to implement the ray-triangle intersection algorithms. We first made some Vector3D variables such as e1, e2, s, s1, and s2. 
            We then set a Vector3D for the resultant vector after we use the algorithm. Then from that vector we extracted t, b1, and b2. Then we checked if the point was in 
            the triangle using barycentric coordinates, by checking if b1 and b2 were positive and if b1 + b2 was smaller than 1. We also checked if the t was greater than 
            the ray’s min t and less than the ray’s max t. If the point was indeed inside the triangle, then we would set the ray’s max t to the resultant vector’s t and 
            return true. If not, then we returned false.

 <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
     
     <p>
         For the most part, we followed the given specifications to implement our BVH construction 
         algorithm. The condition for which a given node is a leaf was if the number of primitives 
         that we iterated through was less than the provided <code>max_leaf_size</code> parameter, in which we
         would simply set the start and end of the node to the given start and end iterators and 
         return the node. If the node was not a leaf, we would have to split the primitives into 
         left and right partitions of data, assigning the l and r to recursive calls to 
         <code>construct_bvh</code>, taking in data up to the splitting point and the data from the splitting
         point to the end respectively. For choosing the splitting point, we first determined the
         average of all the centroids to act as the point that splits the data into two. However, 
         we had to then determine the best axis we would need to use to figure out which conditions 
         would be used for categorizing left and right data. To start, we calculated the minimum 
         and maximum x, y, and z values, and from this we determined the range of each axis by 
         subtracting each component’s maximum and minimum. Whichever axis has the largest range 
         would be the one to split as it would be most beneficial to split a longer range of data 
         rather than splitting thinner sets of data. After finding the axis, we used std::partition 
         to partition the primitives by selecting the left data as all those whose component of the 
         chosen axis was less than the average midpoint along our chosen axis.
         <br><br>
         However, after implementing this, we ran into infinite recursion issues with certain models. When debugging the code, it showed that either the start and the split point or the end and the split point were the same, meaning that at a certain point, all of the primitives were ending up on one side, which would cause the code to never reach the base case. To remedy this, after also trying a different split method (median splitting) that succeeded for a few but failed for the rest, we ended up reverting to our original splitting choice and making sure instead to add a base case checking if the split point was either the start or end before calling the function recursively, and if so, we would end the recursion and treat the current node like a leaf node.

         When rendering with the BVH acceleration the cow only takes 1.8284s, but without it 
         takes 78.0784s. Similarly the rendering for the teapot with BVH acceleration is only 
         2.473s, while without it is 151.0347s. These would render faster, but my computer is 
         not the best. The BVH acceleration speeds up the rendering by using recursion to 
         divide the work rather than going through all the primitives indualvidual. It splits 
         up the work. Therefore bring the runtime down from <i>O(n)O(n) to O(log(n))O(log(n))</i>.

    <b>Uniform Hemisphere Sampling:</b> 
    First, we make a coordinate system for a hit point, and make sure that the normal vector N is aligned with
    the Z direction. Then we make <code>w_out</code>, which points towards the source of the ray, by
    inverting the ray’s direction. We then for loop through all of the samples. For each 
    sample we normalize the sample and create another ray using the hit_p and world space. 
    We also offsetted the ray by <code>EPS_F</code> to avoid precision errors. Then we check if the ray
    intersects the hit_p. If it does we update <code>L-out</code> to <code>L_out + isect.bsdf->f(w_out, w_smpl)
    * the emission of the intersection * dot(w_smpl_wrld, isect.n) / (1.0 / (2 * PI))</code>.
    After the samples have been traversed through, we update <code>L_out</code> by averaging it, and then
    return <code>L_out</code>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Importance Sampling: </b>
We implemented this similar to the one for uniform hemisphere. The differences are that we 
    for loop through all the scene lights. In that loop we check if the current light is the 
    delta light. If so, set num samples to 1. Then we transverse through all the samples. 
    If the cos(theta) value, or the dot product of <code>isect.n</code> and the <code>wi</code> calculated from the current light's <code>sample_L</code> function is negative, we skip intersect operations in the current sample and move to the next sample. If not then we make a ray of <code>hit_p</code> and <code>wi</code>. Then, we check if that ray intersects with the intersection. If it does we
    update the current <code>L_out</code> to itself + <code>isect.bsdf->f(w_out, wi_obj) * sample_radiance *
    dot(wi, isect.n) / pdf</code>. After all the samples have been looped through we average the
    current <code>L_out</code>, and then update <code>L_out</code> to <code>L_out + the averaged current L_out</code>.

<p>
    In terms of more realistic features, uniform hemisphere sampling does appear to take on 
    more realistic forms of shading. Comparatively, importance sampling has a very sharp
    image, making the shading less realistic. The uniform hemisphere shading is more realistic,
    but the image is much noisier compared to the importance sampling one. We see here the
    tradeoff between the 2 different sampling techniques, realistic and noisy or sharper and
    less noisy.

 <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Global Illumination</h2>

<p>
    For the indirect lighting function, we had to implement two functions: <code>at_least_one_bounce_radiance
    </code> and <code>est_radiance_global_illumination</code>. In <code>at_least_one_bounce_radiance </code>, our implementation
    was similar to that of <code>one_bounce_radiance</code> in part 3 in that we used the given reflectance
    function. However, this time, given certain conditions, we would recursively call the function
    to continually bounce to give more accurate rendering results. As mentioned in the spec, 
    these conditions are (1) <b>Russian roulette</b>, in which we use a cpdf (or a continuous pdf
    that is the complement of a termination probability) to calculate a random choice between 
    0 and 1 using the function <code>coin_flip</code> (to test if a random value between 0 and 1 is less
    than the cpdf) to see if we will bounce once we begin reaching the maximum number of 
    bounces, and (2) <code>max_ray_depth</code>, or the maximum number of bounces allowed, <b>is greater
    than 1</b> before the first bounce in which the function guarantees at least one indirect bounce regardless of the Russian
    roulette results. This, of course, would end regardless once <b>the number of bounces
    surpasses the maximum number of bounces</b> defined by <code>max_ray_depth</code>. For each bounce, we would add to L_out the result from the next recursive call of <code>at_least_one_bounce_radiance</code> (taking in parameters of (1) the <b>next ray</b> with an origin at <code>hit_p</code>, a direction of <code>wi</code> calculated from <code>isect.bsdf->sample_f</code>, and a depth of the current ray's depth - 1, and (2) the next ray's <b>Intersection</b>) multipled by <code>isect.bsdf->sample_f(w_out, &wi, &pdf) / pdf * cosine(theta)</code> and divided by <code>cpdf</code> if we use Russian roulette.  If the depth is 0,
    we would just return Vector3D(0,0,0). We then add the result returned by this function
    to the overall reflectance in <code>est_radiance_global_illumination</code>.

To do so, we record several new variables including the current number of samples (which we increment until we decide to converge), <b>s1</b> and <b>s2</b> (which is the sum of illuminance values of the radiance and the same sum squared respectively), as well as the <b>mean</b> and <b>standard deviation</b> of the illuminance values up to the current number of samples and the convergence, which we calculate to be: <pre align="middle">I = 1.96 * standard deviation / sqrt(curr_num_samples)</pre> To reduce the amount of computations, we also calculate convergences in batches of <code>samplesPerBatch</code> values, summing up s1 and s2 for each batch and computing the convergence after each batch. If the convergence I is less than or equal to the given <b><i>maxTolerance * mean</i></b>, we would stop generating rays, update the pixel with the color still calculated as the average radiance, and set the respective position in <code>sampleCountBuffer</code> to the number of samples actually used.
