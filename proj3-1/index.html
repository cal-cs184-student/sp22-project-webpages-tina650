        <p>Use this section to write an overview of the assignment. All of the text in your write-up should be <em>in your own words</em>. If you need to add additional HTML features to this document, you can search the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">http://www.w3schools.com/</a> website for instructions. To edit the HTML, you can just copy and paste existing chunks and fill in the text and image file names appropriately.</p>
        <o>The website writeup is intended to be a self-contained walkthrough of the assignment: we want this to be a piece of work which showcases your understanding of relevant concepts through both mesh images as well as written explanations about what you did to complete each part of the assignment. Try to be as clear and organized as possible when writing about your own output files or extensions to the assignment. We want to understand what you've achieved and how you've done it!</p> 
        <p>If you are well-versed in web development, feel free to ditch this template and make a better looking page. Just make sure that you include all the components as we've laid them out here. </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Intersection</h2>
        
        <p>
            In order to generate a ray, we first changed the hFov and vFov into radians. Then we calculated the max y and y’s by basically taking the tan of half the hFov and vFov. 
            Then, we offset the image by 0.5 x and y. We also then scaled it by dividing the max x and y by 0.5. Then we took those scaled values and multiplied them by the offsets. 
            We used these values to create the final ray. After that we set final ray’s min and max t values to nClip and fClip. Then we return final ray. 
        </p>
        
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>

                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            We used the Moller Trumbore Algorithm to implement the ray-triangle intersection algorithms. We first made some Vector3D variables such as e1, e2, s, s1, and s2. 
            We then set a Vector3D for the resultant vector after we use the algorithm. Then from that vector we extracted t, b1, and b2. Then we checked if the point was in 
            the triangle using barycentric coordinates, by checking if b1 and b2 were positive and if b1 + b2 was smaller than 1. We also checked if the t was greater than 
            the ray’s min t and less than the ray’s max t. If the point was indeed inside the triangle, then we would set the ray’s max t to the resultant vector’s t and 
            return true. If not, then we returned false.

        <p>Here is an example of how to include a simple formula:</p>
        <p align="middle"><pre align="middle">a^2 + b^2 = c^2</pre></p>
        <p>or, alternatively, you can include an SVG image of a LaTex formula.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">A Few Notes On Webpages</h2>
        <p>Here are a few problems students have encountered in the past. You will probably encounter these problems at some point, so don't wait until right before the deadline to check that everything is working. Test your website on the instructional machines early!</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Your main report page should be called index.html.</li>
        <li>Be sure to include and turn in all of the other files (such as images) that are linked in your report!</li>
        <li>Use only <em>relative</em> paths to files, such as <pre>"./images/image.jpg"</pre>
        Do <em>NOT</em> use absolute paths, such as <pre>"/Users/student/Desktop/image.jpg"</pre></li>
        <li>Pay close attention to your filename extensions. Remember that on UNIX systems (such as the instructional machines), capitalization matters. <pre>.png != .jpeg != .jpg != .JPG</pre>
        <li>Be sure to adjust the permissions on your files so that they are world readable. For more information on this please see this tutorial: <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html">http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html</a></li>
        <li>And again, test your website on the instructional machines early!</li>
