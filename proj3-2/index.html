    <h2 align="middle">Part 1</h2>
        
        <p>
            In order to implement the reflect function it was quite easy all we had to do was a 1 line transformation of the x, y, and z coordinates. 
      In order to make the mirror material is a little bit more complicated. In sample_f we had to set the PDF to 1 and call reflect. We had to return 
            reflectance / the absolute cosine of *wi  in order to cancel out the cosine of the one in at least one bounce radiance. Then for refraction
            we just implemented Snell’s equations and applied Snell’s law of refraction. Then for glass material we just use Schlick's approximation.

<p>
<b>Max Ray Depth 0: </b> 
There are 0 bounces of light, so you can see self-emissive objects aka the area light
</p>
<p>
<b>Max Ray Depth 1: </b>
There is 1 bounce of light where we can now see some direct light illuminating. So as you can see we are seeing some of the highlights on the spheres.
</p>
<p>
<b>Max Ray Depth 2: </b>
There are now 2 bounces of light causing indirect illumination. We can now see that the left sphere can now mirror its surroundings. The right sphere which is supposed to be glass is starting to reflect and refract some light. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Max Ray Depth 3: </b>
With 3 bounces of light we see the right glass sphere becoming more glass-like with it actually reflecting and refracting most of the light. Also you can see light refracted under the glass ball. The mirror ball looks more or less the same as with 2 light bounces.
</p>
<p>
<b>Max Ray Depth 4: </b>
With 4 light bounces the reflection of the glass ball in the mirror ball it's finally glass like and no longer dark. Also the glass ball becomes glossier more glass light due to the added light bounce. Also the white spot due to the reflection of light from the glass ball is finally starting to appear on the purple wall.
</p>
<p>
<b>Max Ray Depth 5: </b>
With 5 light bounces The picture doesn't change too much. Light bounces and more reflection and refraction the picture is brighter and a little less noisy. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Max Ray Depth 100: </b>
Now that we have 100 light bounces the resulting picture actually is not too different from the pictures with 4 and 5 light bounces. With all these added light bounces we can see that the picture is brighter and a little less noisy, but overall nothing much has changed.

        <p>
            When comparing the different alpha values, we see that a lower alpha value corresponds to a much smoother, shinier, 
            and reflective surface, whereas a higher alpha corresponds with a much rougher, less 
            reflective surface that gives off most of its base color rather than a reflection of its 
            surroundings.

    <h2 align="middle">Working as Partners</h2>
        <p>
            As for working with a partner, since we only had a complete 2 parts for this project we decided to split up the two parts.
            Tina took part 1, and Daniel took part 2. When we worked on the project we worked in the same room next to each other but on different parts. 
            If someone needed debugging or help with the code we would just ask the other person. Even though we did separate the parts and have one point 
            person to eat we ended up collaborating on both parts a good amount. One thing we learned was that we Should continue working on projects in the
            same room together. During the beginning of this project we did it from our respective homes since we were on spring break, And when we finally 
            came back to campus we decided to meet up and work on the project. significantly a lot more got done when we were in the same room together to 
            make sure each other were on task and for faster answers to debugging or conceptual questions each other might have had. So collaborating in the 
            same room worked really well and that's something we're going to continue to do in the future.
